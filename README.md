### Quantum Teleportation Protocol
To transfer a quantum bit, Alice and Bob must use a third party (Telamon) to send them an entangled qubit pair. Alice then performs some operations on their qubit and sends the results to Bob over a classical communication channel. Bob then performs some operations on their end to receive Aliceâ€™s qubit.
### Principles of Quantum Teleportation
- **Entanglement :**
Entanglement occurs when the control qubit in a controlled gate is in
a superposition.Therefore, the state of one qubit depends on another qubit, which is
also in a superposition.
- **Quantum Measurement :** 
Quantum measurement allows us to extract information from a quantum system. However, when a quantum system is measured, its state generally collapses into one of the possible measurement outcomes. This collapse is probabilistic, and the outcome cannot be determined with certainty in advance.
