### Quantum-Teleportation
Quantum teleportation allows the transfer of quantum states from one location to another without physically transporting the particles themselves. It relies on the principles of quantum entanglement and quantum measurement to transmit the information encoded in a quantum state.
### Principles of Quantum Teleportation
- **Entanglement :**
Entanglement occurs when the control qubit in a controlled gate is in
a superposition.Therefore, the state of one qubit depends on another qubit, which is
also in a superposition.
- **Quantum Measurement :** 
Quantum measurement allows us to extract information from a quantum system. However, when a quantum system is measured, its state generally collapses into one of the possible measurement outcomes. This collapse is probabilistic, and the outcome cannot be determined with certainty in advance.
